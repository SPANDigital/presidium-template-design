This article should explain the role color plays in the design system, such as:

* Indicating activity or interactivity.
* How an accent color can be used in a dark or light theme.
* Cultural aspects of color, for example, the meaning of green and red (different in non-Asian and Asian cultures) or blue (associated with virtue and protection in some cultures and with mourning in others).
