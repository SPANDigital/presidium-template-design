Design tokens are a recently new addition to the design system landscape. The term and concept have been championed by Salesforce, which describes design tokens as: "...'visual design “atoms' for building a design for your components or apps. Specifically, they’re named entities that store visual design attributes, such as pixel values for margins and spacing, font sizes and families, or hex values for colors. Tokens are a terrific way to centralize the low-level values, which you then use to compose the styles that make up the design of your component or app."

A design token is a piece of UI information that can be used be used across several platforms. They make it possible to update an element (colors, fonts, animations) in a central location, then roll that update out to all applications that use that element.
