Design tokens are a recently new addition to the design system landscape. The term and concept have been championed by Salesforce, which describes design tokens as: "...'visual design “atoms' for building a design for your components or apps. Specifically, they’re named entities that store visual design attributes, such as pixel values for margins and spacing, font sizes and families, or hex values for colors. Tokens are a terrific way to centralize the low-level values, which you then use to compose the styles that make up the design of your component or app."

Design tokens bridge the gap between design and development. Instead of using static hardcoded values, you name properties that represent visual attributes (such as color, font families, layers, sizing, spacing). One update affects all in code (css, sass, html).
