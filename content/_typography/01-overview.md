This article should contain information about the design principles related to the selected typography. Additionally, it should include examples of the typography on its own and, optionally, in context. It may include a link for downloading the font family.

Some design systems will specify a single font while others might define a set of allowable fonts for different application types.

This section can include the following articles:
* **Type scale**, such as small, medium, large (with examples)
* **Additional emphasis** for type, such as strong (with examples )
* **Display styles** for titles, headings, subheadings, captions, and so on (with examples)
* **Emphasis styles** to communicate content hierarchy (with examples)
* **Font stack** (with CSS code sample)

Other possible articles include:
* Terms & conditions for using a custom font (for example, not using that font externally for personal projects)
* Guidelines for the different application of fonts in applications and marketing or sales materials
